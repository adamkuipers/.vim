THE PROJECTOR SHOWS LAST COUPLE FRAMES OF NEUROSIS NOW AS JOHANN APPLAUDS AS HE GETS THE LIGHTS


Johann: "Who was that handsome stud who was responsible for everything about that video?"

Girl: Johann that is the 15th time you've made me watch this. Sometimes I think you use me as an excuse to drive up your youtube hits.

Johann laughs nervously, giving an insinuating glance toward Henry in the closet.

Johann: "So you didn't like it?"

GIRL: "Johann you have been promising me to take me out on a real date for the past 3 years and every goddamn time you just bring me to your room and have me watch your stupid youtubes--

<But like I said before, the floral coated man... so passionate... so handsome>

Johann looks perplexed at such a strange comment and continues onward.

Johann: "THAT'S NOT THE FULL SUPRISE HENRY GET ON OUT HERE"

Henry clumsily emerges from the closet.

Johann: "You were always saying how you didn't get my videos because you couldn't relate to them so suprise! Now you are in one!"

GIRL forms a cold, blank expression on her face. She glares intensely into the camera.

GIRL: "Oh wow Johann when you told me that your suprise was going to blow my mind I think you meant to say that your ineptitude will make me want to blow my head off"

Johann: "So you don't like it?'

GIRL GRABS THE CAMERA FROM HENRYS HANDS AND TALKS INTO IT LIKE THAT ONE HORROR MOVIE

GIRL:"TO ALL THE 14 PEOPLE JOHANN MAKES WATCH THIS, LET THE RECORD STATE THAT HE IS AN INCONSIDERATE ASSHOLE WHO, FOR EVERY HOLIDAY OF OUR RELATIONSHIP, HAS PRETENDED TO BE SICK. AND ITS MY BIRTHDAY. ITS MY BIRTHDAY EVERYBODY. ITS MY FREAKING BIRTHDAY."

Johann: "Babe we have like 73 likes on the page but... so... you don't like this?"

GIRL FUMBLES WITH HER PHONE AND STARTS <PLAYING>/SINGING? A TLC's "I dont want no Scrub" AND sasses off

Johann chases after her while calling for henry. They climb down the stairs as Johann's parents laugh.

Mom: "He got dumped by another one!"

Dad: "World record!"

Sister: "Leave her alone"
 
GIRL then climbs into her car and drives off as johann melodramatically falls to his knees and bemoans his loss. Henry non-chalantly checks his cellphone, missing he dramatic shot johann was aiming for.

Johann: "Goddamnit henry not only did i just get dumped but your lackadaisical approach just fucked me out of a viral video jesus fucking christ goddamnit"

NEUROSIS NOW



PT II: ADAMS SCENE

HENRY WALKS INTO ADAM'S ROOM. ADAM IS LOOKING VERY DEPRESSED [ACTING]. SAD MUSIC IS PLAYING FROM HIS COMPUTER AND HE HIS LOOKING AT PHOTOS WITH BOTH AMANDA AND ADAM. 

ADAM:
She the last message she sent was a smile emoticon. 

THE LAST CONVERSATION IS ON THE MONITOR 

ADAM:
And then, two weeks later, I notice my friend count is down. At first I assumed it was just another humorless cretan, 
resentful of my superior tweets or that another spam account was  deleted  by facebook. 

STARES AT CAMERA
I will never deny a friend request. The facebook friend count is the only objective measurement of worth we have today.

ADAM:
I can't believe I agreed to do this.

JOHANN REVEALS THAT HE WAS BEHIND HENRY AND COMES INTO SCENE
JOHANN:
Adam. We may never get a more organic oportunity to show the devastating
consequences of deleting a friend from facebook. You picking up the last item
of yours from her house must be documented. If not for society. If not for
America. Do it for the fact that this will be the guaranteed viral hit that
Neurosis Now needs to be featured on Tosh.0. 

ADAM LET'S OUT A LONG WINDED SIGH
ADAM:
Let's get this over with.

END SCENE






ADAM IS DRIVING TO THE HOUSE. HENRY IS IN PASSENGER SCENE FILMING. 
ADAM:
It hurts man. It really hurts. You think you're friends with someone. You tag them in your status update.
Great facebook chats. Even the video chats, I never resented her for taking up all my attention from the 
rest of the internet. Our You and I page was full. And then this. Out of nowhere. She *CHOKES* unfriends me.
I just hope this is as painless as possible. 

THEY GET TO THE HOUSE. 
ADAM: 
This may be a mistake. 

ADAM GETS OUT OF HIS CAR AND WALKS UP TO THE DOOR. 

ADAM:
Damn her.

HENRY PANS DOWN TO REVEAL THE BOX OF RECORDS AT THE FOOT OF HER DOOR.

ADAM:
She couldn't even face me. I know my Whitney Huston quip was without taste. But that's 
how I cope with death! 

CAMERA CUTS IN AND OUT OF MANY SHOTS OF ADAM LEMENTING. 

LYNDSAYS' SONG "20" PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND. 

FADE OUT.
